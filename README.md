 # A league of legends web application that allows you to get your basic profile informations and match history (development api)

 ## Why did i do this project ?

 I wanted to train on ReactJS and i like LOL.
 
 ## How to use

 Enter the name of the player you wish to search for ( :information_source: works only for EUW :information_source: )

 :heavy_exclamation_mark: You need to get a valid API key to and write it everytime the constant ApiKey is initialized :heavy_exclamation_mark:

 ## Demo

 You can check my demo here: [Vercel Demo](https://league-search-lemon.vercel.app)

 ## Is the demo working ?

 No it isn't. Since API Keys last 1 day, i don't have the time to refresh it everyday.
